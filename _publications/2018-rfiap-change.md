#### Abstract

This paper presents convolutional neural network architectures which perform change detection using a pair of coregistered images. Most notably, we propose Siamese extensions of fully convolutional networks which use heuristics about the current problem to achieve the best re-
sults in our tests on two open change detection datasets,
using both RGB and multispectral images. We show that
our system is able to learn from scratch using annotated
change detection images. Our architectures achieve better performance than previously proposed methods, while
being at least 500 times faster than related systems. We
also present a change detection dataset that was developed
using Sentinel-2 images.
