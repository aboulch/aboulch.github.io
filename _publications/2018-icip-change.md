#### Abstract

This paper presents three fully convolutional neural network
architectures which perform change detection using a pair of
coregistered images. Most notably, we propose two Siamese
extensions of fully convolutional networks which use heuristics about the current problem to achieve the best results in our
tests on two open change detection datasets, using both RGB
and multispectral images. We show that our system is able to
learn from scratch using annotated change detection images.
Our architectures achieve better performance than previously
proposed methods, while being at least 500 times faster than
related systems. This work is a step towards efficient processing of data from large scale Earth observation systems such
as Copernicus or Landsat.
